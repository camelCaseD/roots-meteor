# Root Quiz
This is a simple quiz program forked from Meteor's todos example app. It is designed so that students can quiz themselves of the definitions of roots for their english class.

## Adding/Modifying Roots
If you want to add a root or modify it simply fork the repo then go to server/bootstrap.js in your fork and modify the list of roots. After you're done editing the file create a PR stating exactly what it is you changed about the roots. After merging the PR I'll reset the server then redeploy it with the new modifications.
